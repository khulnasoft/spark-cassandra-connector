/** All non-equal predicates on a TimeUUID column are going to fail and fail
  * in silent way. The basic issue here is that when you use a comparison on
  * a time UUID column in C* it compares based on the Time portion of the UUID. When
  * Spark executes this filter (unhandled behavior) it will compare lexically, this
  * will lead to results being incorrectly filtered out of the set. As long as the
  * range predicate is handled completely by the connector the correct result
  * will be obtained.
